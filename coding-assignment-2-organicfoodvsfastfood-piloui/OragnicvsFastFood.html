      <h1> Organic Food vs Fast Food </h1>
      <section>
        <h2>What is organic food</h2>
        <p>The term "organic" refers to the process of how certain foods are produced.
          Organic foods have been grown or farmed without the use of artificial chemicals, hormones, antibiotics or genetically modified organisms.
          <br>In order to be labelled organic, a food product must be free of artificial food additives.
          This includes artificial sweeteners, preservatives, coloring, flavoring and monosodium glutamate (MSG).
          Organically grown crops tend to use natural fertilizers like manure to improve plant growth. Animals raised organically are also not given antibiotics or hormones.</p>
